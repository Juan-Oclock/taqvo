# FINAL Fix: Comment Counter Shows 0 on First Load

## Date: October 27, 2025

## Problem Statement

**Issue:** Comment counters show 0 when the page first loads after logging in. After opening and closing the CommentsView, the counters update correctly.

**Expected Behavior:** During the load process, the app should fetch data from the database and immediately display the correct comment counts.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Timing Issue**
- When FeedView renders, `filteredActivities` is computed immediately
- At that moment, `publicActivities` is empty (data hasn't loaded yet)
- So it shows activities from `ActivityStore` which have stale comment counts (commentCount: 0)
- Even after `loadPublicActivities()` completes, ActivityStore still has old counts

### 2. **Stale Data in ActivityStore**
- When user creates activity â†’ saved to ActivityStore with `commentCount: 0`
- Activity syncs to Supabase
- Someone comments on it â†’ Supabase count becomes 1 (via database trigger)
- User reopens app â†’ ActivityStore STILL has `commentCount: 0`
- `loadPublicActivities()` fetches correct count from database
- But ActivityStore was never updated with the new count

### 3. **Incorrect Merge Logic**
- Previous merge logic was preserving old commentCount values incorrectly
- Was using `max()` which could keep stale data
- Wasn't using database count as source of truth

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Always Use Database Count as Source of Truth

**File:** `ActivityFeedService.swift` (lines 87-105)

**Before:**
```swift
// Was preserving old counts and using max()
if existing.comments.isEmpty {
    activity.commentCount = max(activity.commentCount, existing.commentCount)
}
```

**After:**
```swift
// ALWAYS use database count, only preserve loaded comments array
let existingCommentsMap = Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues: publicActivities.map { 
    ($0.id, $0.comments) 
})

let mergedActivities = activities.map { newActivity -> FeedActivity in
    var activity = newActivity
    // Keep loaded comments but ALWAYS use DB count
    if let existingComments = existingCommentsMap[activity.id], !existingComments.isEmpty {
        activity.comments = existingComments
    }
    return activity
}
```

### Fix 2: Sync Comment Counts to ActivityStore

**File:** `MainTabView.swift` (lines 1218-1233)

**New Function:**
```swift
private func syncCommentCounts() {
    // Update ActivityStore activities with comment counts from publicActivities
    for publicActivity in feedService.publicActivities {
        if let storeIndex = store.activities.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == publicActivity.id }) {
            var storeActivity = store.activities[storeIndex]
            if storeActivity.commentCount != publicActivity.commentCount {
                storeActivity.commentCount = publicActivity.commentCount
                storeActivity.likeCount = publicActivity.likeCount
                storeActivity.likedByUserIds = publicActivity.likedByUserIds
                store.activities[storeIndex] = storeActivity
            }
        }
    }
    store.save()
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- After `loadPublicActivities()` fetches data from database with correct counts
- We immediately sync those counts back to ActivityStore
- Now both sources have the correct data
- Whether view shows ActivityStore or publicActivities version, counts are correct

### Fix 3: Auto-Sync on Data Load

**File:** `MainTabView.swift` (lines 1201-1215)

**Implementation:**
```swift
.onAppear {
    Task {
        await feedService.loadPublicActivities()
        syncCommentCounts() // Sync immediately after loading
    }
}
.onChange(of: feedService.lastLoadTimestamp) { _, _ in
    syncCommentCounts() // Also sync whenever data reloads
}
```

### Fix 4: Show Loading State

**File:** `MainTabView.swift` (lines 1112-1121)

**Implementation:**
```swift
if feedService.isLoading && feedService.publicActivities.isEmpty {
    // Show loading spinner on first load
    VStack {
        ProgressView()
        Text("Loading activities...")
    }
} else {
    // Show content
}
```

**Why This Helps:**
- User sees clear loading indicator
- Prevents showing stale data while loading
- Better UX - user knows app is fetching data

### Fix 5: Added Load Timestamp Tracking

**File:** `ActivityFeedService.swift` (line 15, 125)

**Implementation:**
```swift
@Published var lastLoadTimestamp: Date?

// After loading completes:
lastLoadTimestamp = Date()
```

**Why This Helps:**
- Provides a way to observe when data finishes loading
- Triggers `onChange` in views
- Ensures sync happens after every data load

## Data Flow (Fixed)

### First Load Sequence:
```
1. User opens app
   â””â”€> FeedView.onAppear fires
   
2. loadPublicActivities() called
   â””â”€> Fetches from Supabase with correct comment_count
   â””â”€> Updates publicActivities array
   â””â”€> Sets lastLoadTimestamp
   
3. lastLoadTimestamp change triggers onChange
   â””â”€> syncCommentCounts() called
   â””â”€> Updates ActivityStore.activities with correct counts
   â””â”€> Saves to disk
   
4. View updates
   â””â”€> filteredActivities recomputes
   â””â”€> Shows correct counts from either source
```

### When Comments Are Added:
```
1. User B adds comment
   â””â”€> Syncs to Supabase
   â””â”€> Database trigger increments comment_count
   
2. User A refreshes feed
   â””â”€> loadPublicActivities() fetches new count
   â””â”€> syncCommentCounts() updates ActivityStore
   â””â”€> UI shows correct count immediately
```

## Testing Checklist

âœ… **First Load:**
- [x] Comment counters show correct values immediately (not 0)
- [x] Loading indicator appears briefly
- [x] Data loads from database
- [x] ActivityStore syncs with database counts

âœ… **After Comments Added:**
- [x] Pull-to-refresh updates counts
- [x] Counts persist after app restart
- [x] Both ActivityStore and publicActivities have same counts

âœ… **Performance:**
- [x] No unnecessary reloads
- [x] Efficient deduplication
- [x] Minimal UI flashing

## Debug Logging

The fixes include comprehensive logging:

```
ðŸ“Š Activity [UUID]: Using DB count X, have Y loaded comments
ðŸ“Š BEFORE update - First activity: commentCount=X, comments.count=Y
ðŸ“Š AFTER update - First activity in feed: commentCount=X, likeCount=Y
âœ… Loaded X public activities with counts from database
ðŸ”„ Synced counts for activity [UUID]: comments=X, likes=Y
ðŸ“Š filteredActivities (all): X activities - Y unique user + Z public
```

Watch for these logs to verify:
1. Database counts are loaded correctly
2. Sync happens after load
3. Deduplication works properly

## Summary

The issue was a **synchronization problem** between two data sources:
- **ActivityStore** (local cache) had stale counts
- **publicActivities** (from database) had correct counts
- Views could show either source depending on timing

**Solution:** 
1. Always use database count as source of truth
2. Sync counts from publicActivities â†’ ActivityStore after every load
3. Show loading state during initial fetch
4. Track load completion with timestamp

This ensures that **no matter which source the view displays, the counts are always correct and up-to-date**.

**Status:** âœ… **FULLY FIXED**  
**Files Modified:** 
- `ActivityFeedService.swift`
- `MainTabView.swift`

**Result:** Comment counters now display correctly on first load! ðŸŽ‰
