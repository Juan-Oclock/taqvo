# Likes & Comments Synchronization Fixes

## Problem Overview

Based on your diagram showing the expected flow, the likes and comments functionality had several critical synchronization issues:

### Issues Identified

1. **`handleLike` in FeedView wasn't syncing to backend** - Backend sync was commented out (TODO)
2. **Optimistic updates weren't reflected across all views** - Updates to `ActivityStore` didn't propagate to `ActivityFeedService`
3. **`loadPublicActivities` only loaded current user's like status** - Didn't populate full `likedByUserIds` array for all users
4. **Comment updates weren't merging properly** - New comments could overwrite existing comment arrays
5. **NotificationCenter events weren't handled intelligently** - Simple replacement instead of smart merging

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed `handleLike` in FeedView (MainTabView.swift)

**Before:**
```swift
private func handleLike(activity: FeedActivity) {
    // Only local update
    store.updateActivity(updatedActivity)
    // TODO: Persist to backend (commented out)
}
```

**After:**
```swift
private func handleLike(activity: FeedActivity) {
    // Optimistically update both local store AND feed service
    store.updateActivity(updatedActivity)
    feedService.updateActivity(updatedActivity)
    
    // Sync to backend with proper error handling
    Task {
        await store.toggleLike(activityID: activity.id)
        // Reload to ensure server truth
        await feedService.loadPublicActivities(limit: 20)
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Immediate UI update (optimistic)
- ✅ Backend sync with rollback on failure
- ✅ Updates both local and community feeds
- ✅ Server truth enforced after sync

### 2. Enhanced `refreshFeed` (MainTabView.swift)

**Before:**
```swift
private func refreshFeed() async {
    await community.refresh() // Only challenges
}
```

**After:**
```swift
private func refreshFeed() async {
    await community.refresh()
    await feedService.loadPublicActivities() // Now reloads activities too!
}
```

### 3. Improved `ActivityFeedService.updateActivity` (ActivityFeedService.swift)

**Before:**
```swift
func updateActivity(_ updatedActivity: FeedActivity) {
    publicActivities[index] = updatedActivity // Simple replacement
}
```

**After:**
```swift
func updateActivity(_ updatedActivity: FeedActivity) {
    // Intelligent merge
    var merged = updatedActivity
    
    // Preserve comments if updated version is missing them
    if merged.comments.isEmpty && !existingActivity.comments.isEmpty {
        merged.comments = existingActivity.comments
    }
    
    // Use max count for safety
    merged.commentCount = max(merged.commentCount, existingActivity.commentCount)
    
    publicActivities[index] = merged
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Preserves existing comment data
- ✅ Uses highest count from either source
- ✅ Prevents data loss during optimistic updates

### 4. Enhanced `ActivityStore.updateActivity` (ActivityStore.swift)

**Before:**
```swift
@MainActor
func updateActivity(_ updatedActivity: FeedActivity) {
    activities[index] = updatedActivity // Simple replacement
    NotificationCenter.default.post(...)
}
```

**After:**
```swift
@MainActor
func updateActivity(_ updatedActivity: FeedActivity) {
    // Intelligent merge preserving comments
    var merged = updatedActivity
    if merged.comments.isEmpty && !existingActivity.comments.isEmpty {
        merged.comments = existingActivity.comments
    }
    merged.commentCount = max(merged.commentCount, existingActivity.commentCount)
    
    activities[index] = merged
    
    // Always broadcast update (even for activities not in local store)
    NotificationCenter.default.post(...)
}
```

### 5. Improved `ActivityStore.addComment` (ActivityStore.swift)

**Before:**
```swift
func addComment(...) {
    guard let idx = activities.firstIndex(...) else { return } // Failed for public activities
    // Only updated local store
}
```

**After:**
```swift
func addComment(...) {
    if let idx = activities.firstIndex(...) {
        // Update local store
        activities[idx] = updatedActivity
        NotificationCenter.default.post(...)
    } else {
        // Activity not in local store - still broadcast for public feed!
        NotificationCenter.default.post(...)
    }
    
    // Sync to backend
    Task { await supabase.addComment(...) }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Handles both local and public activities
- ✅ Broadcasts updates regardless of source
- ✅ Proper backend sync with error handling

### 6. Enhanced ActivityFeedService Notification Handler (ActivityFeedService.swift)

**Before:**
```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(...) { notification in
    self?.updateActivity(activity) // Simple pass-through
}
```

**After:**
```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(...) { notification in
    // Smart merge in the notification handler itself
    var existingActivity = self.publicActivities[existingIndex]
    
    // Merge likes
    existingActivity.likeCount = activity.likeCount
    existingActivity.likedByUserIds = activity.likedByUserIds
    
    // Merge comments (only add new ones, don't duplicate)
    let existingCommentIds = Set(existingActivity.comments.map { $0.id })
    let newComments = activity.comments.filter { !existingCommentIds.contains($0.id) }
    existingActivity.comments.append(contentsOf: newComments)
    
    self.publicActivities[existingIndex] = existingActivity
}
```

## Data Flow (Fixed)

### User A Creates Public Activity
1. Activity saved to `ActivityStore`
2. Synced to Supabase via `SupabaseCommunityDataSource`
3. Broadcasts `activityUpdated` notification
4. `ActivityFeedService` receives notification and adds to `publicActivities`

### User B Likes Activity
1. **Optimistic Update:** Like immediately reflected in UI
   - `store.updateActivity(updatedActivity)` - Updates local store
   - `feedService.updateActivity(updatedActivity)` - Updates community feed
2. **Backend Sync:** `store.toggleLike(activityID)` syncs to Supabase
3. **Server Truth:** `feedService.loadPublicActivities()` reloads from server
4. **Rollback on Failure:** If backend sync fails, optimistic update is reverted

### User B Comments on Activity
1. **Optimistic Update:** Comment immediately added to UI
   - Comment appended to local `comments` array
   - `commentCount` incremented
2. **Broadcast:** `activityUpdated` notification sent
3. **Feed Service Update:** Intelligently merges new comment without duplicates
4. **Backend Sync:** Comment synced to Supabase
5. **User A Sees Update:** Via pull-to-refresh or `activityUpdated` notification

### User A Sees Updates
1. **Real-time:** Receives `activityUpdated` notifications
2. **Pull-to-refresh:** Calls `refreshFeed()` which reloads both challenges and activities
3. **Smart Merge:** Updates are merged intelligently preserving existing data

## Architecture Improvements

### Optimistic UI Updates
- Changes appear instantly before backend confirmation
- Rollback mechanism for failures
- Server truth enforced after sync

### Dual Source Updates
- Updates propagate to both `ActivityStore` (local) and `ActivityFeedService` (community)
- NotificationCenter ensures all observers are notified
- Smart merging prevents data loss

### Intelligent Merging
- Comments are appended, not replaced
- Like status properly tracked per user
- Counts use `max()` to prevent decrement bugs
- Comment IDs prevent duplicates

## Database Triggers (Already Implemented)

The Supabase migration file (`supabase-migration-likes-comments.sql`) includes automatic triggers:

```sql
-- Trigger to auto-update like_count
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_like_count
    AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON public.activity_likes
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_activity_like_count();

-- Trigger to auto-update comment_count
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_comment_count
    AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON public.activity_comments
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_activity_comment_count();
```

This ensures the database counts are always accurate!

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Scenario 1: User A creates activity**
- Activity appears in User A's feed immediately
- Activity syncs to Supabase
- Activity appears in community feed for all users

✅ **Scenario 2: User B likes User A's activity**
- Like button turns red immediately (optimistic)
- Like count increments
- Backend sync happens in background
- If sync fails, like is reverted

✅ **Scenario 3: User B comments on User A's activity**
- Comment appears immediately for User B
- Comment syncs to backend
- User A sees comment on next refresh or via notification

✅ **Scenario 4: User A refreshes feed**
- Pull-to-refresh reloads activities from server
- Likes and comment counts are accurate
- Comments are preserved and merged

✅ **Scenario 5: Multiple users like/comment**
- Each user's like status is tracked independently
- Comments don't duplicate when merging
- Counts reflect server truth

## Key Files Modified

1. **MainTabView.swift**
   - `handleLike()` - Fixed to sync with backend
   - `refreshFeed()` - Enhanced to reload activities

2. **ActivityStore.swift**
   - `updateActivity()` - Intelligent merging
   - `addComment()` - Handles both local and public activities

3. **ActivityFeedService.swift**
   - `updateActivity()` - Smart merging logic
   - NotificationCenter observer - Intelligent comment merging

## Migration Notes

No database migration needed! The fixes are client-side only and work with the existing Supabase schema defined in `supabase-migration-likes-comments.sql`.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimistic updates**: Instant UI feedback
- **Background sync**: Non-blocking backend operations
- **Smart caching**: Preserves data during merges
- **Debounced reloads**: 200ms delay prevents excessive API calls

## Additional Bug Fix: Comment Counter Shows 0 on First Load

### Problem
When the page loads for the first time after logging in, comment counters show 0, but after opening and closing the CommentsView, the counters update correctly.

### Root Cause
The issue was **duplicate activities** in the feed:
1. User's own public activities exist in **both** `ActivityStore` (local) and `ActivityFeedService` (community)
2. When combining them in `filteredActivities`, duplicates were not removed
3. The activity from `ActivityStore` (which doesn't have updated comment counts) was sometimes displayed instead of the one from `ActivityFeedService` (which has correct server counts)

### Solution
Added **deduplication logic** in `filteredActivities`:

```swift
// Deduplicate: if an activity exists in both, prefer publicActivities (has server counts)
let publicActivityIds = Set(publicActivities.map { $0.id })
let uniqueUserActivities = userActivities.filter { !publicActivityIds.contains($0.id) }

// Combine and sort
let combined = (uniqueUserActivities + publicActivities)
    .sorted { $0.endDate > $1.endDate }
```

**Why this works:**
- Activities in `publicActivities` have the correct `commentCount` from the database
- We filter out duplicates from `userActivities` before combining
- This ensures the version with correct counts is always shown

### Additional Improvements
1. **Explicit objectWillChange**: Added `objectWillChange.send()` before updating `publicActivities` to ensure SwiftUI detects the change
2. **Debug logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track comment counts through the data flow
3. **Merge logic fix**: Updated merge logic to preserve correct counts when reloading

## Known Limitations

1. **Real-time updates**: Currently requires manual refresh. Consider adding Supabase real-time subscriptions for instant updates without pull-to-refresh.
2. **Offline support**: Comments/likes made offline will sync when connection is restored, but no explicit retry logic yet.
3. **Conflict resolution**: Last-write-wins. Consider optimistic locking for better conflict handling.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Supabase Real-time**: Subscribe to activity updates for instant notifications
2. **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff for failed syncs
3. **Conflict resolution**: Proper merge strategies for simultaneous edits
4. **Loading states**: Show sync status in UI
5. **Optimistic rollback UI**: Visual indication when sync fails
